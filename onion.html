			      <p class="flow-text" style="font-size: 16px">Bonding is crucial. <br><br>Think of the endless number of things you don't know about your friends, including the very things that really matter. <br><br>Following these instructions, you will be asked to enter the number of participants for this session, and the number of questions each person can ask. Every person will take turns typing in their questions. Remember, each question should probe deeper and be slightly more engaging than the previous. The goal is to peel away the layers of your peers, much like you would do to an onion, to discover something completely new about them.<br><br>Questions will be organized in sets or "layers" and will be asked randomly, so anonymity is preserved. Only the participant will know what his or her questions were. Take the time to go around in a circle, having each person in the group take as much time as needed to answer a question.<br><br>Remember, listen to others. Be honest. This is an open and judgment-free space. <br><br>Who knows? Maybe you'll be surprised with what you hear.<br><br></p>
